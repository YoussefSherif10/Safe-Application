# Safe-Application
 This project is based on the ATMEGA 32 controller. It is a safe that can be opened by an eight digits password. First, enter the password then confirm it by re-entering, if the confirmation is correct then the DC motor that is responsible for the safe will rotate in the open direction, if the confirmation is false then the motor rotates in the opposite direction to lock the safe even more. I used LCD to show the password and the confirmation.

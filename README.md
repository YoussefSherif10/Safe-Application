# Safe-Application
 The ATMEGA 32 controller is the foundation of this project. It is a safe that needs an eight-digit password to unlock. Enter the password once, then confirm it by typing it in again. If the confirmation is accurate, the safe's DC motor will revolve in the open direction, but if it's incorrect, the motor will rotate in the opposite direction, further locking the safe. I displayed the password and the confirmation using an LCD.
